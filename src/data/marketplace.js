With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. ",

            "Amazon DynamoDB Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling. With DynamoDB, you can create database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale up or scale down your tables' throughput capacity without downtime or performance degradation, and use the AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilization and performance metrics. DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for your tables over a sufficient number of servers to handle your throughput and storage requirements, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. All of your data is stored on solid state disks (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS region, providing built-in high availability and data durability. ",

                'The BatchGetItem operation returns the attributes of one or more items from one or more tables. You identify requested items by primary key. A single operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data, which can contain as many as 100 items. BatchGetItem returns a partial result if the response size limit is exceeded, the table\'s provisioned throughput is exceeded, or an internal processing failure occurs. If a partial result is returned, the operation returns a value for UnprocessedKeys. You can use this value to retry the operation starting with the next item to get.  If you request more than 100 items, BatchGetItem returns a ValidationException with the message "Too many items requested for the BatchGetItem call."  For example, if you ask to retrieve 100 items, but each individual item is 300 KB in size, the system returns 52 items (so as not to exceed the 16 MB limit). It also returns an appropriate UnprocessedKeys value so you can get the next page of results. If desired, your application can include its own logic to assemble the pages of results into one dataset. If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchGetItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. If *at least one* of the items is successfully processed, then BatchGetItem completes successfully, while returning the keys of the unread items in UnprocessedKeys.  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.  By default, BatchGetItem performs eventually consistent reads on every table in the request. If you want strongly consistent reads instead, you can set ConsistentRead to true for any or all tables. In order to minimize response latency, BatchGetItem retrieves items in parallel. When designing your application, keep in mind that DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order. To help parse the response by item, include the primary key values for the items in your request in the ProjectionExpression parameter. If a requested item does not exist, it is not returned in the result. Requests for nonexistent items consume the minimum read capacity units according to the type of read.

                "The BatchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A single call to BatchWriteItem can write up to 16 MB of data, which can comprise as many as 25 put or delete requests. Individual items to be written can be as large as 400 KB.   BatchWriteItem cannot update items. To update items, use the UpdateItem action.  The individual PutItem and DeleteItem operations specified in BatchWriteItem are atomic; however BatchWriteItem as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the UnprocessedItems response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call BatchWriteItem in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new BatchWriteItem request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed. If *none* of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchWriteItem returns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException.  If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, *we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm*. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.  With BatchWriteItem, you can efficiently write or delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale operations, BatchWriteItem does not behave in the same way as individual PutItem and DeleteItem calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and BatchWriteItem does not return deleted items in the response. If you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at a time. In both situations, BatchWriteItem performs the specified put and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of the thread pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your application. Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and delete request consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is processed in parallel or not. Delete operations on nonexistent items consume one write capacity unit. If one or more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire batch write operation:  *  One or more tables specified in the BatchWriteItem request does not exist. \n *  Primary key attributes specified on an item in the request do not match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema. \n *  You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request. For example, you cannot put and delete the same item in the same BatchWriteItem request.  \n *   Your request contains at least two items with identical hash and range keys (which essentially is two put operations).  \n *  There are more than 25 requests in the batch. \n *  Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB. \n *  The total request size exceeds 16 MB. \n ",

When you establish an AWS account, the account has initial limits on the maximum read capacity units and write capacity units that you can provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given Region. Also, there are per-table limits that apply when you create a table there. For more information, see Limits page in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*. Although you can increase these limits by filing a case at AWS Support Center, obtaining the increase is not instantaneous. The DescribeLimits action lets you write code to compare the capacity you are currently using to those limits imposed by your account so that you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a limit. For example, you could use one of the AWS SDKs to do the following:  2.  Call DescribeLimits for a particular Region to obtain your current account limits on provisioned capacity there. \n 4.  Create a variable to hold the aggregate read capacity units provisioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggregate write capacity units. Zero them both. \n 6.  Call ListTables to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables. \n 8.  For each table name listed by ListTables, do the following: \n\t *  Call DescribeTable with the table name. \n\t *  Use the data returned by DescribeTable to add the read capacity units and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to your variables. \n\t *  If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs), loop over these GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your variables as well. \n\t  \n 10.  Report the account limits for that Region returned by DescribeLimits, along with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have calculated. \n  This will let you see whether you are getting close to your account-level limits. The per-table limits apply only when you are creating a new table. They restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the new table itself and all its global secondary indexes. For existing tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase provisioned capacity extremely rapidly. But the only upper limit that applies is that the aggregate provisioned capacity over all your tables and GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account limits.

If LastEvaluatedKey is present in the response, you need to paginate the result set. For more information, see Paginating the Results in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.   Scan operations proceed sequentially; however, for faster performance on a large table or secondary index, applications can request a parallel Scan operation by providing the Segment and TotalSegments parameters. For more information, see Parallel Scan in the *Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide*.  Scan uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the data in a table; therefore, the result set might not include the changes to data in the table immediately before the operation began. If you need a consistent copy of the data, as of the time that the Scan begins, you can set the ConsistentRead parameter to true.",

TTL compares the current time in epoch time format to the time stored in the TTL attribute of an item.

The epoch time format is the number of seconds elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.   DynamoDB deletes expired items on a best-effort basis to ensure availability of throughput for other data operations.   DynamoDB typically deletes expired items within two days of expiration. The exact duration within which an item gets deleted after expiration is specific to the nature of the workload. Items that have expired and not been deleted will still show up in reads, queries, and scans.  As items are deleted, they are removed from any local secondary index and global secondary index immediately in the same eventually consistent way as a standard delete operation.

Valuable time is lost shuttling between screens and executing repeatable tasks while an attack continues to manifest.\nThis Access Investigation content pack contains the ‘Access Investigation - Generic’ playbook, that automates response to an unauthorised access incident. The pack also contains the corresponding custom Access incident type to facilitate analyst investigation.\nThe Access playbook orchestrates across multiple products to extract and enrich IOCs, interact with the suspected user and calculate the incident’s severity.\n\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbooks included in this pack help you save time and automate repetitive tasks associated with Malware incidents:\n- Create an Access incident within Cortex XSOAR associated with the unauthorized access.\n- Extract and enrich user information, and retrieve the user’s manager details.\n- Extract and enrich IP information.\n- Interact with the user to gather more information regarding the suspected access.\n- Calculate the incident’s severity based on the enriched information and information received from the user.\n- Assign the investigation to an analyst.\n\nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box Access incident type, which is easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our  [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/access-investigation---generic)_\n\n![Access_Investigation_-_Generic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/a5e419535b376b08764f65670c24ea364072e869/Packs/AccessInvestigation/doc_files/Access_Investigation_-_Generic_4_5.png)\n",

      "All 50 US states, Washington, DC, and most US territories (including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands) have passed breach notification laws that require notifying state residents and the Attorney General in case of a personally identifiable information (PII) security breach.\nThis US Breach Notification content pack includes playbooks that help to determine if the breached data meets the criteria for breach notification for the relevant state, and, if necessary, follows through with the notification procedures.\nWith this package, it will be possible to understand whether a breach occurred and whether the notification is required. In addition, you can shorten the notification time in case of breach according to the state law.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbooks included in this pack help you automate repetitive tasks associated with US breach notification incidents:\n- Checks whether the breached data was encrypted or if the encryption key was compromised.\n- Checks the types of PII that were compromised, however, each state determines what is considered PII, and which PII requires notification.\n- Checks if the PII that was compromised contained living residents in the selected state.\n- Asks the DPO (Data Protection Officer) to confirm the breach.\n- In case notification is required, the pack assists with the notification process to send a breach notification to the following: Affected residents, State Attorney General, Consumer Reporting Agencies, and State CISO (if required).\n\nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box US breach notification incident views, and a full layout. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/us---breach-notification)_\n\n![US-BreachNotification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/master/Packs/BreachNotification-US/doc_files/US_-_Breach_Notification.png)\n",

      "# Case Management Pack Implementation Guide\n\nThis dashboard is a quick primer for using this Case Management Pack.  Whether you're creating Incidents manually in XSOAR, or fetching from a SIEM, this pack provides some helpful content to help with those goals.\n\n## Default Incident Type\n\nThis Pack includes an Incident Type of 'Case', which has optimized layouts for Case Management, including for manual Incident creation.  To use this as a default for XSOAR, navigate to Settings -> Advanced -> Incident Types and select Case and Set as Default.\n\n## Incident Ingestion\n\nSetting Case as the default type means you can enable a fetch from any integration and it will default to this type.  This means no mapping & classification is really required, as data from the incoming incident will be displayed in the labels section.  This means you can quickly bring in alerts from various systems, and then further tune the data, layouts, and playbooks as future improvements.\n\n## Layouts\n\nThe Case type has an optimized layout for both the summary pages, and the new/edit screen.  This layout includes some useful action buttons for Analysts to utilize in their day to day.\n\nThis layout can use used as a template for future Incident types you create in your system, you can copy it (5.5) or use as the default for a Incident type (6.0)\n\n## Playbook\n\nThe default playbook for the Case type is 'Case Management - Generic', this playbook is very simple, but does have a few optional add-ons you might want to enable.  At it's core the playbook simply does the following:\n\n- Extract & Enrich Indicators: Extract IOCs (hashes, ips, urls) from the incoming Incident data, and mark these items as a note.\n- Pause and wait for Analyst review\n\n### Timers\n\nOptionally this playbook has built in Timers for adding metrics for Mean Time to Assignment or Mean Time to Remediation to the metrics you are tracking in the system.  To take advantage of these timers, you can add the included TimersOnOwnerChange script to as a field trigger script on the Owner field.   This script will stop the Time to Assignment timer and start the Remediation SLA timer when an owner is first assigned to the Incident.\n\nTo set this up:\n1. Settings -> Advanced -> Fields\n2. Find and edit the Owner field\n3. Select TimersOnOwnerChange on the 'Script to run when field value changes' option\n\n## Dashboards\n\nThis pack includes 3 dashboards:\n\n- Incident Overview: High level summary of all Incidents in the system, by type, severity, owner, unassigned, etc.\n- My Incidents: Analyst focused dashboard for them to work Incidents assigned to them or Incidents they are participating in.  This dashboard also shows any War Room chats they may have been mentioned in.\n- Case Management Implementation Guide: That's this dashboard, and is intended as a guide for implementing this pack, feel free to delete it once done.\n\n### Optional Widgets\n\nThere are 3 optional widgets you can add to these dashboards, if you've enabled the Timers as noted above:\n\n- Mean Time to Assignment: Shows the average time to assignment for Incidents in the system where the Time to Assignment Timer was used.\n- Mean Time to Remediation (Remediation SLA): Shows the average time to remediation for Incidents where the Remediation SLA Timer was used.\n- My Mean Time to Remediation (Remediation SLA): Shows the average time to remediation for Incidents where the Owner is the viewing user.\n\nYou can add these Timers to existing or a new dashboard from the home screen!  If you're building your own playbooks, you can include these timers to track these metrics on those as well!\n\n## Incident Action Buttons\n\nThis pack includes a pair of useful Incident action button scripts, which are added to the layout included in this pack, but can be added to any other Incident types you create or out of the box types:\n\n- Assign to Me (AssignToMeButton): Assigns an Incident to the user who clicked the button.\n- Link Incidents (LinkIncidents): Allows a user to link or unlink Incidents, also takes a comma separated list of Incidents to link or unlink.\n\n# What Next?\n\nWant to take it to the next level?  The next steps after implementing this pack might include the following:\n\n- Pivot incoming alerts from SIEMs etc to their own Incident types, with their own playbooks to automate away the mundane!\n- Use pre-processing rules to drop or link duplicate alerts!\n- Map data from incoming alerts to fields, allowing search ability, correlation of Incidents between different alert sources (i.e. map a username from different sources to the same field in XSOAR!)\n- Modify the Case layout on new types, replacing the labels section with the data from the incoming Incident that you mapped to fields.  This maintains a consistent look and feel for your Analysts, but places the information they need directly on the Incident.\n\nFin.\n",

      "The Code42 Insider Threat Remediation content pack is an integrated offering that enables security teams to scale, standardize and automate certain insider threat incident response processes based on preset triggers within Cortex XSOAR.\nA common trigger includes an email sent from a human capital management (HCM) system, indicating an employee has resigned or is leaving the organization.\nThe content pack provides security teams with a configurable lookback of an employee’s historic file movements, including browser uploads and cloud sync activity, and then automatically generates an alert to a recipient, such as the employee's manager, for review.\nThis detailed information can be used to easily determine sanctioned or unsanctioned activity, speed investigations and enable security teams to take a right-sized approach to incident response.\n\n[Try Code42 Incydr at no cost for 30 days](https://www.code42.com/trial/?utm_medium=app-exchange&utm_source=partner-panw&utm_campaign=ent_panw-partner-marketplace-site&utm_content=trial&utm_term=external-webpage-link|start-your-30-days-free)\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbooks included in this pack handle the following use-cases:\n- Investigating a departing employee for suspicious activity.\n- Automate generating departing employees from ticketing systems.\n- Automate attaching files from exposure-activity to ticketing systems.\n- Take actions on employees with when activity is reported as suspicious, such as blocking the user or adding them to legal hold.\n",

The input value is searched in the first list (input_values). \nIf it exists, the value from the second list (mapped_values) at the same index is retutrned. If there is no match, the original value is returned.\nIf the original input is a dictionary, then the script will look for a "stringified" version of the key/:/value pair in the input_values and then map the result in the output_values into the original "value".\n\nExample 1:\n\ninput_values = "1,2,3,4"\nmapper_values = "4,3,2,1"\nvalue = 3\n\nOutput would be "2"\n\nExample 2:\n\ninput_values ="firstkey: datahere,secondkey: datathere"\nmapper_values = "datathere,datahere"\nvalue(dict)= {\n                                "firstkey": "datahere"\n                          }\n\nOutput would be:\n                          {\n                                "firstkey": "datathere"\n                           }\n\nThe reason for matching the key AND value pair in a dictionary is to allow the mappig of values that have a specific key name. In most cases, dictionaries will continan key-value pairs in which the values are the same. You might want to change the value of KeyA, but not the value of KeyB. This method gives control over which key is changed.\n\nWhen the input is a dict, str , int, or list, the output is ALWAYS returned as a string.',

      'ConcentricAI Semantic Intelligence\n\nConcentric’s Semantic Intelligence™ solution discovers and protects business critical, unstructured data.\nWe use deep learning to identify risky sharing, inappropriate third party access, assets in the wrong location, \nmis-classified documents, or lateral movement of data – all without rules or complex upfront configuration.\n\nAbout this Pack\n\nThe ConcentricAI Integration Pack includes the "ConcentricAI Semantic Intelligence Integration Pack" which helps to pull in alerts from ConcentricAI into Demisto as incidents. These incidents indicate key information such as risk types\nidentified along with location of risky file i.e path along with name. These incidents can also fetch the appropriate file details via Playbook along\nwith all other files the user/owner might have interacted with with the help of "ConcentricAI Demo Playbook".This pack also contains the custom ConcentricAI Security\nEvent incident along along with classifiers and mappers to facilitate analyst investigation.\n\nWhat does this pack do : \n\nThis pack enables you to monitor threats via Demisto Platform and fetch important information related to incidents. it also helps do repetitive tasks associated with\nConcentricAI Security Event :\n   1) Fetches Alerts as Incidents into Demisto\n   2) Triggers a custom playbook to fetch all relevant details such as user information and file details for every incident.\n   3) Calculates the severity of the incident.\n   \nFor more information please visit concentric.ai ',

      "Cortex XDR is a detection and response app that natively integrates network, endpoint and cloud data to stop sophisticated attacks.\nResponding and managing these attacks requires security teams to reconcile data from multiple sources. Valuable time is lost shuttling between screens and executing repeatable tasks while an attack continues to manifest.\nThis Cortex XDR content pack contains the ‘Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR - Investigation and Response’ integration, that enable direct execution of Cortex XDR actions within Cortex XSOAR, ‘Cortex XDR Incident Handling v2` playbook, that enables bidirectional incident updates between Cortex XDR and Cortex XSOAR, and the Cortex XDR - Malware Investigation’ and ‘Cortex XDR - Port Scan - Adjusted’ sub-playbooks. The pack also contains the corresponding custom Cortex XDR incident fields, views and layouts to facilitate analyst investigation.  \n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbooks included in this pack help you save time and keep your incidents in sync. They also help automate repetitive tasks associated with Cortex XDR incidents:\n- Syncs and updates Cortex XDR incidents\n- Trigger a sub-playbook to handle each alert by type\n- Extract and enrich all relevant indicators from the source alert.\n- Hunt for related IOCs\n- Calculate the severity of the incident\n- Interact with the analyst to choose a remediation path or close the incident as a false positive based on the gathered information and incident severity\n- Remediate the incident by blocking malicious indicators and isolating infected endpoints\n\nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box Cortex XDR incident type views,  with incident fields and a full layout. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/cortex-xdr-incident-handling-v2)_\n\n![Cortex XDR incident handling v2](https://github.com/demisto/content/raw/3fadebe9e16eb7c9fc28ce3bb600319ec875e3b5/Packs/CortexXDR/doc_files/Cortex_XDR_incident_handling_v2.png)",

      "Increase Incident Response Speed and Accuracy with Cortex XSOAR and Farsight Security DNSDB®.\n\n##### Overview\nFarsight Security DNSDB® is the world’s largest DNS intelligence database that provides a unique, fact-based, multifaceted view of the configuration of the global Internet infrastructure. DNSDB leverages the richness of Farsight’s Security Information Exchange (SIE) data-sharing platform and is engineered and operated by leading DNS experts. Farsight collects Passive DNS data from its global sensor array. It then filters and verifies the DNS transactions before inserting them into the DNSDB, along with ICANN-sponsored zone file access download data. \n\nTo measurably improve the speed and accuracy of incident response, security analysts need to uncover and gain context for all connected DNS-related digital artifacts, in seconds, using a comprehensive, intelligent search process. By leveraging the Cortex XSOAR Farsight DNSDB integration, security practitioners can automate critical tasks to gain actionable insights into existing threat indicators and avoid dead time by coordinating actions across security projects on a single console. Add to existing Cortex XSOAR workflows to auto generate the query and populate the contextual information for all IPs and domain names.\n\n##### Integration Features:\n- **IP Enrichment**: Enable the retrieval of hostnames that resolve to IP addresses to infer the reason the victim connected to a given IP address.\n- **Hostname Enrichment**: Find all IPs that a hostname has been observed resolving to around the time of observation to identify flows to command-and-control systems that change their IP addresses to avoid detection.\n- **Find Related Hostnames**: Find other hostnames that have resolved to the same IP address as the target hostname to expand on threat intelligence by identifying alternative command-and-control hostnames that may be using common infrastructure.\n- **Interactive Investigations**: Use the DNSDB API via DBOT to automatically add the findings to an investigation. Perform advanced, interactive searches to aid investigations beyond the scope of provided playbooks.\n\n##### Use Case #1: Automated Enrichment\n\n**Challenge**: Incident response teams have visibility to DNS as it currently sits and can only resolve DNS from name-to-record.  They need a reliable reverse-resolution and DNS history and the ability to pivot from IP to name and vice versa to retrieve the totality of logs related to an incident. For example, teams want to retrieve net flows related to a hostname.\n\n**Solution**: Farsight provides the playbooks that integrate into your incident response process. Employing the Farsight Hostname from IP, IPs from Hostname and Related Hostnames playbooks in Cortex automates the search. Teams can retrieve all hostnames seen for a given IP. Conversely, teams can retrieve all IPs for a given hostname or pivot to retrieve a limited number of other hostnames seen on the same IPs as the target hostname. These playbooks can be incorporated into your incident response pipeline for automated retrieval of relevant log data.\n\n**Benefit**: Automated IP to Hostname queries reduces the time needed to respond to incursions and provide a comprehensive view of the attacker’s infrastructure. Automatic expansion and enrichment of search base saves time because all of data is assembled.\n\n![Playbook summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/master/Packs/DNSDB/doc_files/playbook.png)\n\n##### Use Case #2: Automated enhancement of interactive forensic investigations\n\n**Challenge**: Time is of the essence when responding to an incident. Threat teams need to be able to expand investigations to move beyond the scope of standard playbooks to perform advanced searches.\n\n**Solution**: Using the DNSDB API via DBOT, automatically adds the search findings to an investigation. This allows the user to perform advanced, interactive searches that will aid their investigation beyond the scope of provided playbooks.\n\n**Benefit**: Increases the efficacy of other playbooks by automatically enriching the findings with real-time and historical DNS data.\n\n![DBot example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/master/Packs/DNSDB/doc_files/dbot.png)\n\n##### About Farsight Security \n\n[Farsight Security®](https://farsightsecurity.com) is the world’s largest provider of historical and real-time Passive DNS data. We enable security teams to qualify, enrich and correlate all sources of threat data and ultimately save time when it is most critical - during an attack or investigation.

It can also be used for other incident types by adding the email communication layout to the different incident types.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe layout helps you communicate and respond to emails in the Cortex XSOAR system:\n- Add CC to the email\n- Write the email you want to send\n- Add attachments if needed to the email.\n- Tag all the related emails (incoming/outgoing) to the incident and manage as an email thread - the user can view all the communications in the layout without leaving the system.\n\nThis pack includes, out of the box, a full layout, scripts, and incident fields. All of these are customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/)\n\n![Email_Communication_layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/master/Packs/EmailCommunication/doc_files/Email_Communication_layout.png)\n",

    readme:
      "\r\nThe process of offboarding employees is time-consuming and involves multiple departments of the organization - HR, IT, logistics and so on. Due to the multitude of processes, the right actions are not always taken and the process takes too long to complete or never completes fully - leaving the company vulnerable to data leaks, unauthorized access and other risks associated with an incomplete offboarding process. Using Cortex XSOAR, you can streamline this process, track your offboarding checklist and automate any tasks that don't require physical human interaction.\r\n\r\n##### What does this pack do?\r\n- Schedules a time for the offboarding process to begin.\r\n- Gathers employee and manager information from various sources such as Active Directory, Okta, Duo, Google, ServiceNow and more.\r\n- Delegates permissions and access from offboarded employee to manager.\r\n- Revokes roles, security and access permissions for the offboarded employee and resets passwords.\r\n- Retains important employee information for legal purposes, for a configurable period of time.\r\n- Removes employee information from all systems or applies special policies for offboarded employees.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box incident fields, layouts and playbooks for employee offboarding. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization. The pack features an additional, fully manual playbook for organizations that prefer to keep the process manual, that tracks items on your offboarding checklist.\r\n\r\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/it---employee-offboarding)_\r\n\r\n![IT_Employee_Offboarding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/1bdd5229392bd86f0cc58265a24df23ee3f7e662/docs/images/playbooks/IT_Employee_Offboarding.png)\r\n",

A successful Search is followed by an auto archival process of matching packets on EndaceProbe which can be accessed from an investigation link on the Evidence Board and/or War Room board that can be used to start forensic analysis of the packets history on EndaceProbe.\n3. Finally Download the archived PCAP file to XSOAR system provided the file size is less than a user defined threshold say 10MB. Files greater than this threshold can be accessed or analyzed on EndaceProbe via "Download PCAP link" or "Endace PivotToVision link" displayed on Evidence Board.\n',

      'The Expanse Content Pack for Cortex XSOAR provides full coverage of the Expander and Behavior product capabilities from Expanse to allow SOCs to automate the defense of their Company\'s attack surface. The Integrations included in the Pack enable fetching and mirroring of Expanse Issues into Cortex XSOAR Incidents, and ingestion of Indicators (IPs, Domains and Certificates) referring to the corporate Network Perimeter as discovered by Expanse, a Palo Alto Networks company.\n\nThrough a powerful set of Playbooks, analysts can correlate the discovered information with data provided from internal security systems (such as Palo Alto Networks Cortex Data Lake, Prisma Cloud and Panorama, Active Directory, Splunk SIEM, etc.) to help pinpoint the right owners of assets and automate remediation.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\n- Provides the **Expanse v2** integration (for Expanse Expander and Behavior), which allows XSOAR to collect Expanse Issues and bi-directionally mirror them. Several commands are available to search, tag, and update Issues and Assets in Expanse.\n- Provides a feed integration named **Expanse Expander Feed**, which is compatible with the Cortex XSOAR Threat Intel Management capabilities to retrieve and store discovered assets (IPs, IP Ranges, Domains, Certificates) in Cortex XSOAR for analysis and correlation.\n- Provides an **Expanse Issue** Incident Type with dedicated fields and layouts.\n- Provides a rich set of Playbooks and Subplaybooks that handle the investigation and remediation of Expanse Issues.\n- Provides Dashboards that display the Network perimeter as discovered by Expanse and the status of Expanse Issues.\n\n##### How to use this pack?\n- After the Expanse API key is added in the **Expanse v2** integration and the parameters are set, the Expanse issues will start getting mapped to Expanse Incident type and the **Handle Expanse Incident** Playbook will automatically be launched.\n- If you are only interested in Enrichment and Attribution, you can use the **Handle Expanse Incident - Attribution Only** Playbook instead, by assigning it to the **Expanse Issue** Incident Type.\n\n##### Screenshots\n\n- **Expanse Incidents Dashboard**: The main Dashboard for all the Expanse Incidents.\n\n    ![Expanse Incidents Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/b8efd3c2e9409b02b9c4b1873ff3e783524c5104/Packs/ExpanseV2/doc_files/Expanse_Incidents_Dashboard.png)\n\n- **Expanse Incident Layout**: The included default layout for Expanse Incidents.\n\n    ![Expanse Incident Layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/b8efd3c2e9409b02b9c4b1873ff3e783524c5104/Packs/ExpanseV2/doc_files/Expanse_Incident_Layout.png)\n\n- **Expanse Attribution Report**: The report generated by the main playbook attribution stage after checking multiple log sources and Prisma Cloud environments.\n\n    ![Expanse Attribution Report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/b8efd3c2e9409b02b9c4b1873ff3e783524c5104/Packs/ExpanseV2/doc_files/Expanse_Attribution_Report.png)\n\n- **Handle Expanse Incident - Remediation**: An excerpt of the remediation stage of the main playbook. Note the different branches handling notifications, automatic network remediation and follow up Shadow IT investigation if the asset is marked as Shadow IT by the incident assignee.\n\n    ![Handle Expanse Incident Remediation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/b8efd3c2e9409b02b9c4b1873ff3e783524c5104/Packs/ExpanseV2/doc_files/Handle_Expanse_Incident_Remediation.png)\n\n##### Video\n\n[![Expanse and Cortex XSOAR](https://img.youtube.com/vi/I3Vj-f5VGMk/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3Vj-f5VGMk "Expanse and Cortex XSOAR")\n',

      "Network detection and response. Complete visibility of network communications at enterprise scale, real-time threat detections backed by machine learning, and guided investigation workflows that simplify response.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThis integration enables the following investigative tasks and workflows in Cortex XSOAR as an automated response to ExtraHop Reveal(x) detections:\n\n- Create a Cortex XSOAR incident in real-time when a Reveal(x) detection identifies malicious or non-compliant behavior on your network.\n- Leverage Reveal(x) playbooks to respond with thousands of security actions that accelerate automated investigation and remediation.\n- Send real-time queries to Reveal(x) through the ExtraHop REST API that enable you to search for specific devices, network peers, active protocols, records, and packets that are part of your investigation.\n- Track tickets in Reveal(x) that link detections to your Cortex XSOAR investigation.\n\nThe bundle for this integration includes a single trigger that formats Reveal(x) detections and sends a request to create Cortex XSOAR incidents through the Cortex XSOAR REST API. After an incident is created in Cortex XSOAR, the default ExtraHop playbook assigns an ExtraHop analyst role to the incident, sets up ticket tracking, and runs associated detection playbooks.\n\n**Note:** Incidents are pushed in via the Cortex XSOAR REST API by a trigger running on the ExtraHop Reveal(x) appliance, the Fetch Incidents command is not used.\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/extra-hop-v2) and the [ExtraHop Installation Guide](https://www.extrahop.com/customers/community/bundles/extrahop/demisto-integration/)._\n\nThe following figures show an example of a Reveal(x) detection and the resulting incident and workflows in Cortex XSOAR.\n\n![ExtraHop detection card](https://github.com/demisto/content/raw/master/Packs/ExtraHop/doc_files/ExtraHop_Detection_CVE-2019-0708_BlueKeep.png)\n\n*Figure 1.

      "GDPR data breach investigations require security teams to reconcile data from multiple sources, and follow a series of processes to notify the relevant sources, according to the sensitivity of the information breached. Valuable time is lost shuttling between screens and executing repeatable tasks while the sensitive data is out there and the SLA time to handle the incident keeps ticking.\nThe ‘GDPR’ content pack contains the ‘GDPR Breach Notification’ playbook, that automates response to a data breach incident according to the GDPR requirements. The pack also contains the corresponding GDPR automation scripts, incident fields, views and layouts to facilitate the breach notification process.  \nThe General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy of individuals. ***Disclaimer: This pack does not ensure compliance to the GDPR regulation. Before using the pack, we advise consulting with the relevant authorities, and adjusting it to the organization’s needs.***\n\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbook triggers a GDPR breach incident, and then performs the required tasks that are detailed in GDPR Article 33.\nThe playbook included in this pack helps you save time and automate repetitive tasks associated with GDPR breach notification incidents:\n- Gather the relevant data that is a part of the GDPR Data Breach incident and notify the organization’s Data Protection Officer about the breach.\n- Choose the required remediation path to follow by the GDPR based on the DPO’s investigation.\n- Create a SLA timer of 72 hours for the notification of the relevant supervisory authority, as required by the GDPR Article 33.\n- Generate a breach report as required by the GDPR Article 33.\n- Notify the relevant authorities based on the affected company’s country.\n- If needed, notify the affected individuals about the breach.\n \nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box malware incident type views, with incident classification mapping, fields and a full layout. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our  [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/gdpr-breach-notification)_\n\n![GDPR_Breach_Notification](https://github.com/demisto/content/raw/e1e515a16cafef00c456eea273454ce605c23933/Packs/GDPR/doc_files/GDPR_Breach_Notification.png)\n",

      "HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) is a binding regulation for organizations operating in the USA. The HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, 45 CFR §§ 164.400-414, requires HIPAA covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information. Similar breach notification provisions implemented and enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), apply to vendors of personal health records and their third-party service providers, pursuant to section 13407 of the HITECH Act.\nThis HIPAA Breach Notification content pack includes a playbook that helps to determine if the breached data meets the criteria for breach notification, and, if necessary, follows through with the notification procedures in case of PHI breach according to HIPAA requirements.\nWith this package, helps you streamline and automate the repetitive tasks associated with HIPAA breach notifications incidents.  \n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbook helps you understand whether a breach occurred and whether notifications are required:\n- Checks whether the breached data was encrypted or if the encryption key was compromised.\n- Asks the DPO (Data Protection Officer) to confirm the breached.\n- In case the notification is required, the pack will help with the notification process, to send an breach notification to the following: Affected individuals, the Secretary of HHS, Consumer Reporting Agencies and Media notice \nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box HIPAA breach notification incident views, and a full layout. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/hipaa---breach-notification)_\n\n![HIPAA-BreachNotification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/master/Packs/HIPAA-BreachNotification/doc_files/HIPAA_-_Breach_Notification.png)\n",

The playbook allows you to choose whether to disable the user on the last day of work as opposed to the termination date - this is done via the playbook input being set to True or False.\n\nAn employee will be disabled if either of the following conditions is met:\n- The employee's current employment status is terminated, and is not being rehired.\n- The employee's current employment status is not terminated, but the deactivation time (either last day of work or terminated date, according to user preference) has passed, and additionally the termination date is after the hire date.\n\nTo determine if the the transaction required is rehire or update, the playbooks applies the following logic:\n1. An employee will show as terminated until the hire date.\n2. If an employee is rehired with a past hire date, their employment status changes to active immediately.\n3. If an employee is rehired with a future hire date, their employment status will show as terminated until the hire date and will change to active on the hire date.\n\nNote: an employee may have to be terminated regardless of their employment status being \"terminated\" or 'active\".

      "\r\n  \r\nThis Identity Lifecycle Management pack enables you to provision users from Workday into Active Directory, GitHub, ServiceNow and Okta by performing common HR operations. In addition, you can automatically synchronize users in multiple apps for users created in Okta.\r\n  \r\nThe process of provisioning users, such as adding them to the right groups and roles, giving them proper permissions and access to the necessary tools and creating new new users for them in every newly added app can be arduous and error prone. \r\n  \r\nUsing this content pack, you can automate this interface with your user-management and authentication tools to add users to your various applications, assign them necessary roles, and grant them access to all of the applications with which they will be working. \r\nIn the user-provisioning flow, based on a report from Workday, the playbooks in this pack take information from the User Profile and determine what operation needs to be performed - is this a new hire who needs to be added to the system, does a user's personal information need to be updated, or has the user left the company and needs to be disabled in sensitive systems?\r\nAdditionally, when implementing the app-sync workflow, users are assigned to, or unassigned from, applications in Okta, or when users are added or removed from Okta groups - the app-sync playbook will create, update, enable, or disable the user in the corresponding Cortex XSOAR instance.\r\n  \r\nWith this pack, you can reduce the time your teams spend on HR and IT tasks and standardize the way you manage user provisioning.  \r\n  \r\nWhat does this pack do?  \r\n  \r\n- Pulls Workday reports and Okta application events with user updates\r\n  \r\n- Creates incidents for each user update in the system.  \r\n  \r\n- Determines which action needs to be performed based on the information in the user profile. Each action has its designated playbook to add, update, or remove users from the system.   \r\n  \r\n- Identifies if a hire is an employee being rehired or a first-time hire.  \r\n  \r\n- Communicates with the relevant stakeholders to inform them of any errors that arose in the process.  \r\n  \r\n- Communicates with the relevant stakeholders to obtain necessary credentials.  \r\n  \r\nAs part of this pack, you will also receive out-of-the-box incident and indicator layouts, mappers, and fields. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, please refer to the [Identity Lifecycle Management article](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/identity-lifecycle-management).  \r\n  \r\n![Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/ca197a7b294f0ea80196113d8410f181407d2d15/Images/dashboard_page1.png)  \r\n![Incident](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/096b217ba5b7fc274e077cac228a4df1265b8d2d/Images/incident_page1.PNG)  \r\n![Indicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/096b217ba5b7fc274e077cac228a4df1265b8d2d/Images/indicator_page1.png)\r\n",

    readme:
      "These days when modern applications are moving to cloud computing, access often requires that various authentications take place in order to remotely access company resources. This remote access comes with risks, one of which is the risk of an “impossible traveler”. When the user supposedly connects to the company network more than once from two different faraway locations, in a very short period of time, the connection raises suspicion as to the authenticity of the user. This kind of incident needs to be quickly investigated and treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis pack provides the necessary configuration and checks for determining the legitimacy of remote access attempts, and takes appropriate steps to quickly contain any malicious user activity.\r\n\r\n##### What does this pack do?\r\n- Gathers IP-based information from the addresses used to initiate the connections\r\n- Retrieves information about the user account that initiated the connections\r\n- Calculates the time and distance between user login attempts\r\n- Generates a geographical map of the deduced travel path of the user\r\n- Determines, based on whitelisted IPs, manager decision and supposed speed of travel, whether the traveler is an impossible traveler\r\n- Allows the analyst to block IPs used by the user and disable the user in case of compromise\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box incident fields, layouts and a playbook for impossible traveler investigations. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\r\n\r\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/impossible-traveler)_\r\n\r\n![Impossible_Traveler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/3ea4e5a689c3aef028b01e8960588a6861a54c4e/Packs/ImpossibleTraveler/doc_files/Impossible_Traveler.png)\r\n",

      "This Integrations and Incidents Health Check content pack enables system users to review all of the failed integrations, incidents, and playbooks. \n\nAs part of this pack, you will get out-of-the-box, full layouts, dashboards, an incident type, and incident fields. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization. You can configure the job on an hourly/daily/weekly basis to perform the health check. The job will run the checkup playbook that tests all enabled integrations and searches for open incidents with errors to get their status and retrieve the error information. Additionally, this job will update the dashboards for visibility.\n\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe content included in this pack allows you to view all your failed integrations and open incidents in a single incident:\n- Run tests on all enabled integrations, error messages, and track notes.\n- Search for errors in open incidents. Detail the playbooks and commands that fail and track notes.\n- Optionally re-run the playbook.\n- Send report\n\n_For more information about the pack, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/integrations-and-incident-health-check)\n\n![Incidents_Health_Check_layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/745fcf63b37b76437ba03b6ca407ec92c93107b4/Packs/IntegrationsAndIncidentsHealthCheck/doc_files/Incidents_Health_Check_Layout.png)\n\n![Intigrations_Health_Check_layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/745fcf63b37b76437ba03b6ca407ec92c93107b4/Packs/IntegrationsAndIncidentsHealthCheck/doc_files/Integrations_Health_Check_Layout.png)",

Handling such an alert or incident requires multiple triage, response and mitigation steps involving different teams, 3rd parties service providers and security/IT products.\nWith this content pack, you can significantly reduce the time your security analysts spend on lost or stolen device alerts and standardize the way you manage lost or stolen device incidents.\n\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbooks included in this pack guides you manually through the necessary tasks to remediate a lost or stolen device:\n\n- Enrich device, owner and involved personal information, report the device to authorities.\n- Determine if device lockdown is possible, and if the device is a mobile phone to contact the mobile service provider.\n- Change/Revoke any personal information relevant to the device, bank accounts, AD account, passwords, VPN credentials, etc.\n- Determine if remote wiping is supported by the device, if so follow the business logic to determine if remote wiping is applicable.\n- Revoke the device from the organization's domain, approved lists, and add to appropriate block lists.\n- For the final steps of the playbook, it will guide the analyst to retrieve more information from the owner, open a ticket for a new device, and issue a report to be shared   with the CISO.\n\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs]https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/playbook8)_\n\n![lost_stolen_device](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/1bdd5229392bd86f0cc58265a24df23ee3f7e662/docs/images/playbooks/Lost_Stolen_Device_Playbook.png)\n",

[1] These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account\'s associated permissions level.\n\nPlacing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in. There is a startup folder location for individual user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder that will be checked regardless of which user account logs in.

It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS).\n\nAdversaries may connect to a remote system over RDP/RDS to expand access if the service is enabled and allows access to accounts with known credentials.

Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.\n\nWhen initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising a endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.\n\nPossible playbook uses:\n- The playbook can be used independently to handle and remediate the specific technique.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “Courses of Action - Defense Evasion” playbook to remediate techniques based on the kill chain phase.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “MITRE ATT&CK - Courses of Action” playbook, which can be triggered by different sources and accepts the technique MITRE ATT&CK ID as an input.\n",

Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security).

Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.\n\nFor efficiency, may protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key.

Every New Technology File System (NTFS) formatted partition contains a Master File Table (MFT) that maintains a record for every file/directory on the partition. [1] Within MFT entries are file attributes, [2] such as Extended Attributes (EA) and Data [known as Alternate Data Streams (ADSs) when more than one Data attribute is present], that can be used to store arbitrary data (and even complete files).\n\nAdversaries may store malicious data or binaries in file attribute metadata instead of directly in files. This may be done to evade some defenses, such as static indicator scanning tools and anti-virus.\n\nPossible playbook uses:\n- The playbook can be used independently to handle and remediate the specific technique.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “Courses of Action - Defense Evasion” playbook to remediate techniques based on the kill chain phase.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “MITRE ATT&CK - Courses of Action” playbook, which can be triggered by different sources and accepts the technique MITRE ATT&CK ID as an input.\n",

Following through on their primary objective often requires exploring the network to find their target and subsequently gaining access to it. Reaching their objective often involves pivoting through multiple systems and accounts to gain. Adversaries might install their own remote access tools to accomplish Lateral Movement or use legitimate credentials with native network and operating system tools, which may be stealthier.\n\nPossible playbook triggers:\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “Courses of Action - Collection” playbook to remediate techniques based on kill chain phase.\n- The playbook can be used as a part of the “MITRE ATT&CK - Courses of Action” playbook, that can be triggered by different sources and accepts the technique MITRE ATT&CK ID as an input.\n",

      "The process of ingesting quality threat intelligence, mapping the intelligence reports into MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, and then translating this information into reliable and usable remediation steps can be tedious and very time consuming. This MITRE ATT&CK - Courses of Action Pack contains intelligence-driven Courses of Action (COA) defined by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 team, that will enable you to handle MITRE ATT&CK techniques and sub-techniques in an organized and automated manner. This will make sure your organization is not only blocking specific reported IOCs but also taking a more holistic approach to prevent future attacks.\n\nUsing this content Pack, you can automate this whole process and have all of the information gathered in one place to help you keep your organization protected.\nEach technique is mapped out-of-the-box into the specific Courses of Action that your organization needs in order to stay protected, using Palo Alto Networks products.\n\nWith this Pack, you can reduce the time your teams spend on consuming threat intelligence and translating the reports into action items, and on sustaining best practices policies for your security products. \n\n**What does this Pack do?**\n- Automatically maps MITRE ATT&CK Techniques into Courses of Action playbooks.\n- Takes action to remediate the techniques throughout Palo Alto Networks security products, following the MITRE ATT&CK kill chain.\n- Checks existing profiles against best practices and suggests manual or automated policy changes. \n- The playbooks in the Pack can be triggered manually, by a job, by an incident, or by any threat intelligence feed.\n- MITRE ATT&CK techniques are the playbook inputs and therefore playbooks can be triggered by any 3-rd party tools mapping to this framework.  \n- When used with Unit 42 feed ingesting Actionable Threat Objects and Mitigations (ATOMs) - get notified as soon as there is a new threat actor report and take action immediately. \n\nFor more information, please refer to the [MITRE ATT&CK - Courses of Action article](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/courses-of-action).  \n\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK Dashboard**\n![MITRE_Dashboard](https://github.com/demisto/content/raw/8a574f7099b52404b57b6bb06a1936faed95790d/Images/MITRE_Dashboard.png)\n\n**Unit 42 STIX Report Indicators**\n![Maze_Ransomware](https://github.com/demisto/content/raw/8a574f7099b52404b57b6bb06a1936faed95790d/Images/Maze_Indicator.png)\n\n**MITRE ATT&CK - Courses of Action Sample Playbook**\n![Courses_of_Action](https://github.com/demisto/content/raw/8a574f7099b52404b57b6bb06a1936faed95790d/Images/MITRE_ATT%26CK_CoA_-_T1027.png)\n",

      "Malware, or malicious software, is any program or file that is intentionally designed to be harmful to a computer, server, client or computer network.\nMalware investigations require security teams to reconcile data from multiple malware analysis and threat intelligence tools. Valuable time is lost shuttling between screens and executing repeatable tasks while an attack continues to manifest.\nThis Malware content pack contains the ‘Endpoint Malware Investigation - Generic’ playbook, that automates response to a malware found on an endpoint. The pack also contains the corresponding custom malware incident fields, views and layouts to facilitate analyst investigation.  \nThe Malware playbooks orchestrate across multiple products to extract and enrich IOCs, detonate malicious files, hunt for more IOCs within the organization, and perform remediation on the malware.\n\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbooks included in this pack help you save time and automate repetitive tasks associated with Malware incidents:\n- Create a Malware incident within Cortex XSOAR associated with the Malware.\n- Extract and enrich all relevant indicators from the source alert, including the source endpoint, malicious file and all related IOCs.\n- Retrieve and analyze the malicious file and provide reputation using your sandbox and threat intelligence integrations.\n- Calculate severity for the incident based on initial severity provided, indicator reputations, email authenticity check and critical assets if any are involved.\n- Engage with the analyst regarding potentially harmful tasks such as isolating the source endpoint and other infected endpoints found by the hunting playbook.\n- Remediate the incident by blocking malicious indicators.\n- Generating an investigation report to document the incident’s details.\n \nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box malware incident type views, with incident classification mapping, fields and a full layout. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our  [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/endpoint-malware-investigation---generic)_\n\n![Endpoint_Malware_Investigation_Generic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/1bdd5229392bd86f0cc58265a24df23ee3f7e662/docs/images/playbooks/Endpoint_Malware_Investigation_Generic.png)\n",

      "“Computer Security Incident Handling Guide” by NIST outlines the recommendations for handling a cyber security incident. The NIST Incident Response process contains four steps:\n- Preparation.\n- Detection and Analysis.\n- Containment, Eradication, and Recovery.\n- Post-Incident Activity.\nThis NIST content pack contains several playbooks to help streamline your incident response according to NIST guidelines. \n\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbooks included in this pack help you follow the phases in handling an incident as described in the ‘Handling an Incident’ section of NIST - Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.\nHandling an incident - Computer Security Incident Handling Guide\nhttps://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf\nThe “NIST - Handling an Incident Template” playbook helps analysts follow the stages in handling an incident according to NIST guidelines. The “NIST - Lessons Learned” playbook helps SOC teams process an incident after it occurs and facilitates the lessons learned, organized by NIST stages. \nThe “Access Investigation - Generic - NIST” playbook handles an access incident based on the stages described in the “Computer Security Incident Handling Guide”.\nThe playbook included in this pack helps you save time and automate repetitive tasks associated with Access incidents:\n- Handle the incident based on the stages in “Handling an incident - Computer Security Incident Handling Guide” by NIST.\n- Set the “NIST Stage” field to the different stages most relevant to the ongoing investigation.\n- Gather and enrich user and IP information.\n- Generate an investigation summary report.\n- Notify the relevant parties on the incident.\n- Interact with the suspected user about the activity.\n- Remediate the incident by blocking malicious indicators and disabling the account.\n- Run the “NIST - Lessons learned” sub-playbook to process the incident after the investigation and remediation is over.\n\nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box “NIST” incident type views, with incident fields and a full layout. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our  [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/nist---handling-an-incident-template)_\n\n![NIST_-_Handling_an_Incident_Template](https://github.com/demisto/content/raw/27bbaa2687b4925c24ce03487675960f0c73a42e/Packs/NIST/doc_files/NIST_-_Handling_an_Incident_Template.png)\n",

      "\nResponding and managing cyber security attacks requires security teams to reconcile data from a variety of different sources. Valuable time is lost shuttling between screens and executing repeatable tasks while an attack continues to manifest.\nThis Palo Alto Networks Comprehensive Investigation content pack contains the ‘Palo Alto Networks - Endpoint Malware Investigation v3’ playbook, that automates response to a malware found on an endpoint, the ‘Palo Alto Networks - Malware Remediation` playbook, that automates remediation strategies to many different cyber security incidents, and the `Palo Alto Networks - Hunting And Threat Detection` playbook, that automates hunting for other affected entities in your organizations. \nThe pack also contains the corresponding custom malware incident views and layouts to facilitate analyst investigation.  \nThese playbooks orchestrate across multiple products to extract and enrich IOCs, detonate malicious files, hunt for more IOCs within the organization, and perform remediation using only Palo Alto Networks products.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbooks included in this pack help you save time and automate repetitive tasks using Palo Alto Networks product integrations:\n- Find and link similar incidents\n- Extract and enrich all relevant indicators from the source alert\n- Calculate severity for the incident based on initial severity provided, indicator reputations, email authenticity check and critical assets if any are involved.\n- Hunt for related and affected indicators by leveraging Palo Alto Cortex data received by products\n- Remediate the incident by blocking malicious indicators using many different Palo Alto Networks products and techniques.\n- Generate an investigation report to document the incident’s details.\n\nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box incident type views, with incident fields and a full layout. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/palo-alto-networks---endpoint-malware-investigation-v3)_\n\n![Palo Alto Networks - Endpoint Malware Investigation v3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/e07c7ad07c6f7650bd0bf78d28d4451b5cbe7857/Packs/PANWComprehensiveInvestigation/doc_files/Palo_Alto_Networks_-_Endpoint_Malware_Investigation_v3.png)\n \n\n",

It includes one integration and four automation scripts.\n\n\n### Palo Alto Networks IoT Integration\n---\n\nWrap around the IoT Security Portal APIs for\n - getting a device detail by an ID\n - listing devices\n - listing alerts and vulnerabilities\n - resolving alert and vulnerability\n\nThis integration can be used for the incident response purpose.\n\n### RACI model calculation\n---\n\nBased on a mapping defined in the Settings > Advanced > Lists, the device attributes and the alert/vulnerability fields, this automation script can evalute the "R" and "I" in RACI (Responsible and Informed). This is useful when you have a requirement of assigning incidents to different departments in a large company.\n\n### ServiceNow ticket check\n---\n\nThe way this pack works with ServiceNow is persisting the new ticket ID in a custom field "ServiceNow Record ID". This automation script is to loop all the opened IoT alerts and vulnerabilities in XSOAR, and query ServiceNow for the ticket status. If the status is "CLOSED", the corresponding XSOAR incident will be closed.\n\n### Alert and Vulnerability resolution post-processing script\n---\n\nFor resolving the IoT security portal incidents in the post-processing XSOAR stage.\n',

      "RiskIQ PassiveTotal Premium pack for Cortex XSOAR enables security teams to scale and automate their threat detection and response programs. RiskIQ’s Internet Intelligence Graph provides crucial external context to all internal IOC’s and incidents. This context helps security teams understand how internal assets interact with external infrastructure so they can better detect and prevent attacks. With these insights, security teams can also proactively detect and block the new threat infrastructure that’s part of attacks against their organization that they wouldn’t otherwise know existed.\n\n## Benefits\n\n* Enrich Cortex XSOAR incidents and indicators with Passive DNS, WHOIS, SSL Certificates, Web & Social Trackers, Host Pairs, DNS Records, Open Ports and Services\n* Visualize Internet data alongside existing security telemetry to accelerate triage efforts and provide confidence to analysts or responders\n* Leverage hundreds of Cortex XSOAR third-party product integrations to coordinate response across security functions based on insights from RiskIQ PassiveTotal\n* Run 100s of commands interactively via a ChatOps interface while collaborating with other analysts and Cortex XSOAR’s chatbot\n\n## Automations\n\nRiskIQ is the leader in collecting intelligence from the Internet and making that available for security practitioners. The automations included within this integration stitch data sets directly from RiskIQ PassiveTotal into XSOAR.\n\n## Layouts\n\n### PassiveTotal Domain Indicator\n\nQuickly see Domain details enriched from PassiveTotal directly from within the indicator layout, enabling faster decision making.\n\n### PassiveTotal Email Indicator\n\nQuickly see Email details enriched from PassiveTotal directly from within the indicator layout, enabling faster decision making.\n\n### PassiveTotal File SHA-1 Indicator\n\nQuickly see File SHA-1 details enriched from PassiveTotal directly from within the indicator layout, enabling faster decision making.\n\n### PassiveTotal IP Indicator\n\nQuickly see IP details enriched from PassiveTotal directly from within the indicator layout, enabling faster decision making.\n\n### RiskIQSerialNumber Indicator\n\nQuickly see RiskIQSerialNumber details enriched from PassiveTotal directly from within the indicator layout, enabling faster decision making.\n",

Another feature enables you to specify a filter to create a new smaller PCAP file.

    readme:
      'A common use case in incident response and forensics is analyzing network traffic and protocols by using network packet capture files as part of an investigation. PCAP files provide all the critical traffic data such as IP addresses in use, protocols, as well as the actual payload of the traffic itself. \nThe PCAP Analysis pack includes the PCAP Miner V2 script, as well as playbooks that automate the process of searching for and summarizing data within PCAP files, extracting indicators, decrypting traffic, and more. Cortex XSOAR can leverage the power of Wireshark to parse, search, and extract data from PCAP files. \nWith this content pack, you can significantly reduce the time and effort by automating the process of analyzing PCAP files and not miss out on critical data that can be extracted from them.\nThe PCAP Analysis playbook is meant to demonstrate the full range of PCAP analysis capabilities, however, the most common use case is to use each of the sub-playbooks separately. Review each playbook README for configuration details. \n\n##### What does this pack do?\n\nThe script and playbooks included in this pack help you automate repetitive tasks associated with PCAP files:\n- Search PCAP files for common objects such as IP addresses, ports, protocols, or custom search filters just like in Wireshark.\n- Search for specific regex patterns with the payload.\n- Parse and extract protocol-specific data for several common protocols such as DNS, HTTP, and many more.\n- Display summarized search results.\n- Decrypt various encrypted traffic such as SSL and WPA (as long as decryption keys are provided).\n- Extract indicators such as IP addresses, URLs, domains, and files from the payload and perform enrichment on those indicators.\n\n_We encourage you to [learn more about the PCAP Analysis playbook](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/pcap-analysis)_\n\n## Demo Video\n[![PCAP Analysis in Cortex XSOAR](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VDUdBmGuVYQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDUdBmGuVYQ "PCAP Analysis in Cortex XSOAR")\n\n',

      "Phishing emails are one of the most frequent, easily executable, and harmful security attacks that organizations – regardless of size – face today. High-volume, persistent phishing alerts are a time sink to manage, with incident response requiring coordination between multiple security products and communications with end users. \r\nThis Phishing content pack includes playbooks that automate phishing alert response and custom phishing incident fields, views and layouts to facilitate analyst investigation.  The phishing playbooks orchestrate across multiple products to extract and enrich IOCs, determine severity by cross-referencing against your external threat databases, send communications to your end users, identify and delete all instances of malicious emails to avoid further damage. \r\nWith this content pack, you can significantly reduce the time your security analysts spend on phishing alerts and standardize the way you manage phishing incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### What does this pack do?\r\n- Retrieve emails from user inboxes or ingest them using mail listeners.\r\n- Create a phishing incident within Cortex XSOAR associated with the email.\r\n- Extract and enrich all indicators from email attachments. Analyze files and provide reputation using your sandbox and threat intelligence integrations.\r\n- Generate screenshot of the email and embedded links, and calculate reputation for all indicators involved.\r\n- Run checks for SSL certificates of URLs, email address breach involvement, domain-squatting and email authenticity using SPF, DKIM and DMARC checks.\r\n- Calculate severity for the incident based on initial severity provided, indicator reputations, email authenticity check and critical assets if any are involved.\r\n- Remediate the incident by blocking malicious indicators, searching and deleting malicious emails upon analyst approval\r\n- Engage with the end user regarding the incident such as notifying them of receipt of email and providing further instructions if email is found to be malicious.\r\n\r\nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box phishing incident views, a full layout and automation scripts. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\r\n\r\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/phishing-investigation---generic-v2)_\r\n\r\n![Phishing_Investigation_Generic_v2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/7a20daa4d3560df3be0d2f3f41c00d43ac1a1e23/Packs/Phishing/doc_files/Phishing_Investigation_Generic_v2.png)\r\n",

    readme:
      "Port scanning is a reconnaissance method often used by attackers when gathering information about weak points in networks they want to penetrate, or when looking for valuable targets within an already compromised network. By running port scans, hackers are able to identify running services and potential vulnerabilities that can be used to gain control over systems and eventually pivot and gain control over the organization’s network. Misconfigurations in the network may also create port scan alerts.\r\n\r\nThis pack helps you speed response by providing the necessary configuration and checks for correctly responding to port scans originating outside or within the network, and takes appropriate steps to quickly contain malicious events.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### What does this pack do?\r\n- Gathers information about IPs and enriches hostnames associated with the port scan.\r\n- Identifies critical assets involved in the incident, and escalates the incident accordingly.\r\n- Identifies malware associated with internal network scans, hunts instances of the malware across the organization and blocks it.\r\n- Pivots from attacking IPs to find hosted domains and block them to prevent further malicious activity from the same source.\r\n- Blocks ports upon approval and isolates infected hosts.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box incident fields, layouts and playbooks for port scan investigations. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\r\n\r\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/port-scan---generic)_\r\n\r\n![Port_Scan_Generic](https://github.com/demisto/content/raw/5e428e8319dc849cefd284e8a25ccd7b527604a1/Packs/PortScan/doc_files/Port_Scan_-_Generic.png)\r\n",

      "## Prisma Access Content Pack\n---\n\nThis content pack enables XSOAR to integrate with Palo Alto Networks Prisma Access. It includes 2 integrations.\n\n\n### Prisma Access Egress IP feed\n---\n\nDynamically retrieve and allow IPs Prisma Access uses to egress traffic to the internet and SaaS apps.\n\nThis integration can be used as a TIM feed to fetch indicators, or if a playbook starts from a non-indicator trigger it can use the command to get the IPs.\n\n\n### Prisma Access\n---\n\nIntegrate with Prisma Access to query the status of the service and take actions.\n\nThe integration includes commands to:\n - Force logout a specific user from Prisma Access\n - List currently active users\n - Run a Prisma Access query (e.g. getGPaaSLast90DaysUniqueUsers)\n - Run a custom CLI command\n\nThe integration uses both the Panorama XML API and SSH into the PAN-OS CLI. SSH is based on the netmiko library and will use the netmiko docker image.",

    readme:
      "Automate and unify security incident response across your cloud environments, while still giving a degree of control to dedicated cloud teams. \nCloud adoption has expanded the threat surface and created disparate ecosystems that hamper visibility into security vulnerabilities across the network. In addition, cloud provisioning is often managed by multiple teams, making it hard for security teams to keep pace.\nThe pack includes playbooks that automate Prisma Cloud alert response and custom incident fields, views and layouts to facilitate analyst investigation. The remediation playbooks orchestrate across multiple native cloud integrations (AWS, GCP, Azure) to automate actions like changing policies, revoking access, creating new rules etc. \nWith this content pack, you can significantly reduce the time your Security Analysts/Cloud Operations team spend on Cloud Security alerts and standardize the way you manage misconfiguration incidents.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe playbooks included in this Pack help automate the remediation of alerts generated from the Prisma Cloud platform.\n- Take action on, remediate, and resolve incidents/ alerts from Prisma Cloud.\n- Track configuration issues across all your Cloud environments. \n- Ensure your Cloud environments are compliant and up to date with the latest compliance standards.\n- Configure your Cloud environments using industry best practices.\n\n\nAs part of this pack, you will also get out-of-the-box Prisma Cloud incident views, segregated alert layouts and playbooks. All of these are easily customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/red-lock#configure-prisma-cloud-redlock-on-cortex-xsoar)_\n\n![Prisma_Cloud_Remediation_-_GCP_VPC_Network_Misconfiguration](https://github.com/demisto/content/raw/master/Packs/PrismaCloud/doc_files/PCR_-_GCP_VPC_Network_Misconfig.png)\n",

Login to your Prisma Cloud Compute console.\n1. Navigate to **Manage > Alerts**.\n1. Create a new alert profile by clicking **Add Profile**.\n1. On the left, select **Demisto** from the provider list.\n1. On the right, select the alert triggers. Alert triggers specify which alerts are sent to Demisto.\n1. Click **Save** to save the alert profile\n\n## Configure Demisto\n\n1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Servers & Services**.\n1. Search for **Prisma Cloud Compute**.\n1. Click **Add instance** to create and configure a new integration.\n* **Name**: Name for the integration.\n* **Fetches incidents**: Configures this integration instance to fetch alerts from Prisma Cloud Compute.\n* **Prisma Cloud Compute Console URL**: URL address of your Prisma Cloud Compute console. Copy the address from the alert profile created in Prisma Cloud Compute.\n* **Prisma Cloud Compute Project Name (if applies)**: If using projects in Prisma Cloud Compute, enter the project name here. Copy the project name from the alert profile created in Prisma Cloud Compute.\n* **Trust any certificate (not secure)**: Skips verification of the CA certificate (not recommended).\n* **Use system proxy settings**: Uses the system's proxy settings.\n* **Credentials**: Prisma Cloud Compute login credentials.\n* **Prisma Cloud Compute CA Certificate**: CA Certificate used by Prisma Cloud Compute. Copy the certificate from the alert profile created in Prisma Cloud Compute.\n4. Click **Test** to validate the integration.\n5. Click **Done** to save the integration.\n\n\n## Using the integration and scripts\n\nThe integration ships with four default playbooks, along with four scripts that are used by the playbooks. The scripts encode the raw JSON alerts into Demisto objects that can then be used in the playbooks. The scripts are:\n\n* PrismaCloudComputeParseAuditAlert\n* PrismaCloudComputeParseComplianceAlert\n* PrismaCloudComputeParseVulnerabilityAlert\n* PrismaCloudComputeParseCloudDiscoveryAlert\n\n\nTo better understand how playbooks and scripts interoperate, consider the _Prisma Cloud Compute - Vulnerability Alert_ playbook.\n\n* When the playbook is triggered, a task called **Parse Vulnerability Alert** runs.\n* The task runs the **PrismaCloudComputeParseVulnerabilityAlert** script, which takes the `prismacloudcomputerawalertjson` field of the incident (the raw JSON alert data) as input.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49071222/72902982-1601d000-3d35-11ea-8be2-a12ac8ea8862.png)\n\n\n* Click **outputs** to see how the script transformed the raw JSON input into a Demisto object.\n\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49071222/72903545-1189e700-3d36-11ea-9a35-81b756a5fc6d.png)\n\n\nAt this point, you can add tasks that extend the playbook to check and respond to alerts depending on the properties of the Demisto object.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf any alerts are missing in Demisto, check the status of the integration:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49071222/72086124-18b0fe00-330f-11ea-894b-6b2f9f0528fd.png)\n\nIf you're having further issues, contact [support@demisto.com](mailto:support@demisto.com) and attach the server logs.",

      "# SailPoint IdentityIQ\n\n## Overview\nDigital transformation has opened up opportunities for greater agility and growth in today’s modern enterprises. But it’s also introducing challenges. Digital transformation has introduced an explosion of cloud, applications, data, and users to manage. Being able to effectively control ‘who can have access to what’ is key and if not done properly can lead to potential risk to your business.\n\nTo address this potential risk, organizations are embracing the power and ease of SailPoint Predictive Identity. This innovative identity platform takes the complexity out of identity; making it intuitive for IT staff to configure and manage and enabling business users with the access they need to get their work done. \n\nThe SailPoint IdentityIQ context pack enables XSOAR customers to utilize the deep, enriched contextual data and governance capabilities of the SailPoint Predictive Identity Platform to better drive identity-aware security practices.\n\nThe playbook included with this integration is designed to provide a very simple example of a governance action that can be applied to a simple triggering event.\n\n### Requirements\nThis content pack is compatibility with SailPoint IdentityIQ 8.1 or higher.\n\n### Playbooks\n* SailPoint IdentityIQ Disable User Account Access\n\n#### SailPoint IdentityIQ Disable User Account Access\n\nThis playbook helps perform the following actions:\n* Retrieves Identity contextual data from the SailPoint platform, including identity risk score.\n* Determines if the retrieved risk score exceeds a set threshold of 500.\n* If the threshold is breached, the playbook fetches all accounts associated with the Identity that are represented in IdentityIQ.\n* For each account, a provisioning request is made to disable that users access.\n\n![SailPoint IdentityIQ Disable User Account Access Playbook](doc_files/SailPoint_IdentityIQ_Disable_User_Account_Access.png)\n\n#### IdentityIQ Screenshots\n\n1) Identity in IdentityIQ has SailPoint risk score higher than 500.\n![Identity with High Risk Score](doc_files/High_Risk_User.png)\n\n2) Identity has active 'Active Directory' account.\n![Active Account Associated with User](doc_files/IdentityIQ_Accounts_Active.png)\n\n3) As a result of playbook execution, provisioning request submitted and completed to de-activate Active Directory account.\n![Provisioning Request from Web Services (XSOAR)](doc_files/IdentityIQ_Provisioning_Success.png)\n\n4) Identity now has inactive Active Directory account.\n![Inactive Account Associated with User](doc_files/IdentityIQ_Accounts_Inactive.png)",

      "The Sixgill Darkfeed™ is a stream of malicious indicators of compromise, including domains, URLs, hashes, and IP addresses.\n \nIt relies on Sixgill’s vast collection of deep and dark web sources, and it provides unique and advanced warnings about new cyberthreats.\n \nIt is automated, meaning that IOCs are extracted and delivered in real-time, and it is actionable, meaning that its consumers will be able to receive and block items that threaten their organizations.\n\nDarkfeed™ and pre-built playbooks can automate your key SOC use cases such as Threat Hunting and Malware protection.\n\nThe Darkfeed content pack includes the stream of indicators, a customized dashboard and three playbooks that:\n\n- Automatically download malicious files from a Darkfeed IOC, detonate them in automated sandboxes, and extract and block any additional indicators and files.\n- Automatically discover and enrich indicators with the same actor and source as the triggering IOC. Search for and isolate any compromised endpoints and proactively block IOCs from entering your network.\n\n\nAdditional Information:  \n[Darkfeed Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cPQ76boG8c&feature=emb_logo)  \n[Darkfeed Website](www.cybersixgill.com/darkfeed)  \n[Solution Brief](https://info.cybersixgill.com/hubfs/Cortex_XSOAR/Sixgill_Darkfeed_Cortex_XSOAR_Joint_Solution_Brief.pdf)  \n[Darkfeed Content Pack](https://info.cybersixgill.com/hubfs/Cortex_XSOAR/Sixgill_Darkfeed_CortexXSOAR_Content_Pack.pdf)  \n[Case Study](https://info.cybersixgill.com/hubfs/Cortex_XSOAR/Sixgill_Darkfeed_for_Cortex_XSOAR_Use_Case.pdf)  \n\n\nNote: This pack subscription includes an API key generated by a 3rd party partner. The partner will directly email the end user within 24 hrs instructions for obtaining the key. The user then simply pastes the key into the Sixgill Darkfeed configuration to allow it to function. If you need help or did not receive the key, please contact soar.alliances@paloaltonetworks.com. This pack may or may not have additional content (e.g. playbooks, dashboards) but will still function. Deleting or unsubscribing from this pack will invalidate the API key/access at the end of the month.\n",

      "Threat Intelligence is core to incident response. If you integrate it into your incident response workflow, you can then map external threat data to what’s happening internally.  As hundreds of thousands of indicators may be created or updated on a daily basis, Cortex XSOAR provides the automations that allow you to perform many tasks related to threat intelligence indicators.\nThe TIM - Indicator Auto-Processing pack includes playbooks that automate the processing of indicators for many use cases such as tagging, checking for existence in various exclusion or other lists of interest, running enrichment for specific indicators and preparing indicators if necessary for a manual review in case additional approval is required. This helps you quickly separate relevant indicators from irrelevant ones. \nWith this content pack, you can significantly reduce the time your threat intelligence analysts spend on reviewing hundreds of thousands of indicators by performing many pre-defined logics and processing tasks automatically.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\n\nThe playbooks included in this pack help you automate repetitive tasks associated with with the handling of indicators:\n\n- Check if indicators are related to internal exclusion lists such as business partners or other approved origin.\n- Validate CIDR indicator size in order not to approve or deny large CIDR ranges.\n- Create incidents for indicators that require additional analyst review and chain of approval.\n- Run additional enrichment for indicators ingested by specific feeds.\n- Check Whois to validate domains registrant and time of creation.\n\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks)_\n\n",

      "Whois is a powerful open source tool and protocol for querying details about a domain. Domain details that can be obtained include the domain registrant that owns the domain name, the registrar or service provider who registered the domain, the domain creation date and other metadata related to that domain.\n\nThis Whois content pack contains the Cortex XSOAR and Whois integration that executes the Whois command against the provided domains to provide relevant metadata for the domains. The ‘TIM - Process Domains With Whois’ playbook which accepts domain indicators provided by TIM feeds, contains two subplaybooks that perform tests on domains such as checking the domain registrant or domain age according to user specified inputs, and tagging the domain indicators accordingly.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe Integration included in this pack helps you run the Whois command for domains which provides valuable context and data on domains.\nThe playbooks included in this pack help you save time and automate repetitive tasks associated with investigating data related to Whois enrichment for domains such as:\nAutomating the process of getting domain registrant information and verifying if the registrant is part of the user’s approved list.\nAutomating the process of checking the domain registration age according to the predefined minimum age provided by the user.\n\n\n\nFor more information, visit our  [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/tim---process-domains-with-whois)\n\n![TIM - Process Domains With Whois](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/master/Packs/Whois/doc_files/TIM_-_Process_Domains_With_Whois.png)",

      "# WootCloud Pack\nWootCloud’s integration with Cortex™ XSOAR allows customers to append contextualized alerts with critical intelligence to SOAR workflows so users can build and automate workflows, simplify the incident response process and reduce the amount of human intervention necessary to handle security incidents.\nBy automating time-intensive, manual processes and operational workflows and delivering powerful, consolidated analytics, real-time dashboards and reporting from across the security infrastructure, this integration maximizes the incident response capabilities of over-burdened and understaffed security operations.\n\n### What does this pack do?\n\n    • WootCloud using its HyperContext algorithms classify, correlate and surface event and threats.\n    • Adds deep device fingerprinting to each event, based on network/packet details as well as traffic from Bluetooth and BLE devices.\n    • WootCloud runs algorithms to correlate anomalies and events with detailed information.\n    • Creates highly curated super anomalies with relevant accurate information.\n\n    This event information can be ingested or fetched on demand and be used in building more powerful playbooks for further actions and responses. \n    It can be filtered based on severity and type for granularity.\n",

This integration fetches events (incidents) on new critical assets at risk, new choke points, and trends in the overall risk score. Additionally incidents are enriched with incoming attack vectors to the incident's endpoints, and critical assets at risk form the incident.\r\n\r\n## Use Cases\r\n- New attack path to a critical asset triggers alerts and options to quarantine/disconnect/patch\r\n- New attack technique triggers alerts and options to change policy, and scan endpoints\r\n- Incidents from EDRs are enriched with critical asset information and if the severity is high then action can be taken\r\n",
